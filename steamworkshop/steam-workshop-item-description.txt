It's Harvest Time!

The [b]Hayseed[/b] adds a new character to Slay the Spire with a bounty of farming-themed mechanics and flavor.

This mod introduces 75+ new cards and 16 custom relics, plus unique potions, curses and events.

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
[list][*] Plant [b]Crops[/b] and grow them to maturity—then harvest for a variety of effects. Shuffle your draw pile to grow your crops organically, or play cards designed to accelerate their growth.

[*][b]Seasons[/b] bring a randomized mix of crop power cards to each run for loads of replayability. Seasonal events and curses offer additional variety and flavor.[/list]

The Hayseed supports many strategies—diversify your crop selection, load enemies up with debuffs, harvest early and often for specialized payoffs, or focus on synergies between a few key crops.

[h2]Thanks[/h2]
